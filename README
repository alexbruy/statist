ABOUT STATIST
  The goal of Statist is to provide some basic statistic information for the selected field from
  layer attribute table. Both numeric (integer, real, date) and text (string) fields are supported.

HOW IT WORK
  If there is no selection in the table,the statistics will be calculated for whole table (for all
  records). If a subset of records is currently selected in the attribute table, the statistics will
  be only for the values in the selected records.
  
  For numeric fields (integer, real and date) plugin provide information about:
    - minimum value
    - maximum value
    - mean value
    - sum
    - standard deviation
    - count (shows how many records the statistics are for)
  
  For string fields you can receive next information:
    - minimum string length
    - maximum string length
    - mean string length
    - number of records with empty field
    - number of records with filled field
    - count (shows how many records the statistics are for)
